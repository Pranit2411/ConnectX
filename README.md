# ConnectX

## Project Title: Connect X Reinforcement Learning Strategy Development
### Description:
In this project, I developed a cutting-edge reinforcement learning (RL) model to strategize and optimize gameplay for the Connect X board game. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and reinforcement learning techniques, the project focuses on creating an agent capable of decision-making under various competitive scenarios.

### Key highlights include:

Implemented Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks for strategic gameplay.
Designed and trained models using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Optimized performance by hyperparameter tuning, achieving a high win-rate against baseline and heuristic models.
Explored techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and policy gradients to enhance decision-making.
This project not only advanced my technical skills in AI and RL but also demonstrated the potential of reinforcement learning in solving complex decision-making problems.
